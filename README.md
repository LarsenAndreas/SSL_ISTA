# ISTA-Net Adaptation for Image Super-Resolution
Based on the paper ["ISTA-Net: Interpretable Optimization-Inspired Deep Network for Image Compressive Sensing"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07929), and created as part of a masterâ€™s thesis: "TBD".

## Requirements:
Created using Python 3.10.6. See requirements.txt for further details.

## Usage:
The script is designed such that variables are changed directly in the code. The `training.py` script builds and executes the training loop -- Just provide a list image paths.

## Credit:
Inspired by the original PyTorch implementation ["ISTA-Net-PyTorch"](https://github.com/jianzhangcs/ISTA-Net-PyTorch) by [Jian Zhang](https://github.com/jianzhangcs).
